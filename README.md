# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction - Linear Regression Assignment

## Project Overview

This project is focused on predicting the demand for bike rentals in a bike-sharing system using linear regression. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the number of bikes required at any given hour, based on various features such as weather conditions, time of day, and other contextual factors. This will help the bike-sharing company optimize bike distribution across different stations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains hourly data for bike rentals, along with features like:

- **Datetime**: Hourly date and time stamp.
- **Season**: Season of the year (1: Winter, 2: Spring, 3: Summer, 4: Fall).
- **Holiday**: Whether the day is a holiday (1: Yes, 0: No).
- **Workingday**: Whether the day is a working day (1: Yes, 0: No).
- **Weather**: Weather conditions (1: Clear, 2: Mist, 3: Light Snow, 4: Heavy Rain).
- **Temperature**: Hourly temperature in Celsius.
- **Humidity**: Hourly relative humidity.
- **Windspeed**: Hourly wind speed.
- **Casual**: Number of non-registered users.
- **Registered**: Number of registered users.
- **Count**: Total number of bike rentals (target variable).

## Objectives

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization**:
   - Understand the dataset and the relationships between features.
   - Visualize the distribution of the target variable and features.
   - Identify any potential outliers or anomalies in the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values if any.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features for better model performance.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Develop a linear regression model to predict bike rentals.
   - Evaluate the model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R²).

4. **Model Interpretation**:
   - Analyze the coefficients of the linear regression model.
   - Understand the impact of each feature on bike rental demand.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize the findings and model performance.
   - Discuss potential improvements or further steps.

## Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any other IDE
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Files in the Repository

- **`bike_sharing.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`bike_sharing.csv`**: The dataset used for this assignment.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook bike_sharing.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the analysis and see the results.

## Results

- The linear regression model achieved an R² score of `X` and a RMSE of `Y` on the test set.
- Feature analysis showed that temperature, season, and time of day are strong predictors of bike rental demand.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the application of linear regression in predicting bike rental demand. The model provides valuable insights into the factors affecting bike usage, which can be used by bike-sharing companies to optimize their operations.

## Future Work

- Explore other regression techniques, such as Ridge, Lasso, or Random Forest Regression.
- Include additional features like user behavior data or station-level data for more granular predictions.
- Implement a time-series forecasting model to account for temporal dependencies.
